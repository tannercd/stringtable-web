# StrTable.io
[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com)

This small project was apart of a JavaScript curriculumn created by Jad Joubran. I gave this String Variation table my own spin and became familiar with Node and ESLint for code analysis in the process.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Fork & Clone Repo (Quickstart)
Click the Fork button on the upper right side of the page to easily fork this repository to your own Github account. 
 
* Note: Forking creates a copy of the original repository on your Github Account

Then proceed to `git clone`

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stringtable-web.git
```

### Prerequisites
1. Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. ESLint (https://eslint.org/)

To run this project you will need Node.js installed (use link above) then we can use `npm` to globally install ESLint.

* Installing eslint as a dev-dependency using terminal:
```
npm install --save-dev eslint
```

* With Node.js installed using terminal:
```
npm install eslint -g
```

### Installing
* Fork this repo and clone your own local copy to run the application on any local server to test the String table.

* You can view this application publicly through my Pen (https://codepen.io/spherical/pen/KKdRBmr).

### Coding style tests

This project is using ESLint as a static code analyis tool for finding problematic patterns in JavaScript code. 

To utilize the power of ESLint for code analysis on any JavaScript file. Open a terminal or bash and run: `eslint filename.js` or with npm: `npm run lint`.

## Built With
* Node - JavaScript runtime for Server side JS
* JavaScript - Client side JavaScript
* HTML - Markup langauge to structure web content
* CSS - The stylesheet language
* ESLint - Used for static code analysis

## Acknowledgments
A special thanks to Jad Joubran (@jadjoubran | https://github.com/jadjoubran) for providing the JavaScript course that helped me to modify this project to my liking. These interactive tables that serve populate table data on keyup are quite enjoyable to watch (and build).
