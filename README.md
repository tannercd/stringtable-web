# StrTable.io
[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com)

Project can be viewed on [Codepen.io](https://codepen.io/spherical/pen/KKdRBmr). I gave this string variation table my own spin and became familiar with Node and ESLint for code analysis in the process. Some of the operations are quite useful if you don't want to write a quick function yourself.

## Built With
* Node - JavaScript runtime for Server side JS
* JavaScript - Client side JavaScript
* HTML - Markup langauge to structure web content
* CSS - The stylesheet language
* ESLint - Used for static code analysis

## Acknowledgments
A special thanks to Jad Joubran ([@jadjoubran](https://github.com/jadjoubran)) for providing the JavaScript course that helped me to learn about this project. These interactive tables that populate table data on keyup are quite enjoyable to watch (and build).
